# Burpsuite

Burp Suite is a Java based Web Penetration Testing framework used by information security professionals which helps you identify vulnerabilities and verify attack vectors that are affecting web applications.

Here in this project, we have used WebTech is a Python software that can identify web technologies by visiting a given website, parsing a single response file or replaying a request described in a text file. This way you can have reproducible results and minimize the requests you need to make to a target website. It scans websites and detect software and versions in use and can report data in a structured format like JSON or in a grepable text for later analysis.
